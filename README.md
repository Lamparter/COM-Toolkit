A useful collection of various different COM helpers, including enumerations for different libraries for `PInvoke` via `Microsoft.CsWin32`, and a few other useful utilities.
It also contains a class for interaction with different COM GUIDs by providing them with a name value, which allows for easy interaction with GUIDs via IntelliSense APIs.
